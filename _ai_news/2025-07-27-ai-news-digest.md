  summary: AgentRxiv introduces a framework that allows AI agents to upload and retrieve
    research reports from a shared preprint server, facilitating collaboration and
    iterative improvement. This system enables multiple AI laboratories to work together
    towards common research goals, leading to faster progress and higher accuracy
    in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. The study suggests that autonomous
    agents could play a significant role in future scientific research alongside human
    scientists.
