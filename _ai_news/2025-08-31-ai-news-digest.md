  summary: Microsoft AI launched two homegrown models — MAI‑Voice‑1 (a high‑speed,
    expressive speech generator) and MAI‑1‑preview (an instruction‑following LLM)
    — which are already being integrated into Copilot features and released for limited
    public testing. This marks a strategic shift toward building Microsoft’s own model
    stack (trained on large NVIDIA H100 clusters) while continuing to orchestrate
    multiple specialist models across products. The move reduces Microsoft’s operational
    dependence on external model providers, gives it more control over product integrations
    (voice, on‑device performance and latency), and reshapes competitive dynamics
    among Big Tech AI offerings.

  summary: Samsung and Microsoft announced integration of Microsoft Copilot across
    Samsung’s 2025 TV and smart‑monitor lineup (Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame
    series and smart monitors). Copilot on the big screen supports voice interactions,
    content discovery, personalized recommendations and on‑screen assistance via Tizen
    OS and Samsung Daily+. The partnership brings generative AI experiences into living‑room
    hardware, accelerating the mainstreaming of conversational AI in consumer electronics
    and strengthening Microsoft’s presence beyond PCs and phones.

  summary: Google took its AI coding agent Jules out of beta (Aug 6, 2025). Jules
    runs asynchronously inside Google Cloud VMs, integrates with GitHub (including
    automatic pull requests), and can be given tasks to run while developers step
    away — a different approach from synchronous copilots. The rollout adds structured
    pricing tiers and clearer privacy language, and positions Jules as a hands‑off
    automation tool for bug fixes, refactors and other developer tasks — potentially
    shifting how teams delegate routine coding work and accelerating ‘vibe‑coding’
    and agent‑based workflows.

summary: Microsoft is leveling up its AI game with its own MAI models making their
  debut, which are set to shake up how they integrate AI into products like Copilot.
  Meanwhile, Samsung's 2025 lineup of smart TVs and monitors will come equipped with
  Microsoft Copilot, bringing conversational AI into living rooms and signaling how
  AI is becoming an everyday home companion. Over at Google, the Jules coding agent
  is stepping out of beta, offering developers a way to automate routine tasks asynchronously,
  hinting at a future where AI is more of a silent partner in coding. Plus, if you're
  looking to dive into AI yourself, Tech.co's roundup of free training courses is
  a solid starting point to get those skills going without shelling out cash.
