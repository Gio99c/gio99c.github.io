  summary: 'OpenAI’s highly anticipated GPT-5 — the newest flagship model powering
    ChatGPT — has faced a rocky public rollout, with users posting examples of the
    model making simple math and geography errors and complaining about reduced access
    to older models. Axios reports the problems stem in part from rollout routing
    issues that kept some queries from reaching GPT-5’s slower, higher-quality “reasoning”
    mode; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged glitches, restored older models, and
    said fixes and clearer UI indicators are coming. Why it matters: the stumble underscores
    how technically and reputationally risky major model launches are, even for top
    AI firms, and highlights the challenge of balancing speed, access, and quality
    for large multimodal systems — with implications for customer trust, enterprise
    adoption, and competitive positioning in the fast-moving generative-AI market.'

  summary: 'Speciale Invest announced a plan to deploy 6 billion rupees (about $69
    million) through 2029 to back seed and pre-seed deep‑tech startups in India, with
    a focus that explicitly includes artificial intelligence, space tech, climate
    tech and dual‑use defence. Reuters reports the fund will make initial tickets
    of 70–100 million rupees across roughly 18–20 companies and reserve over half
    the capital for follow‑on investments. Why it matters: the commitment adds notable
    early‑stage capital to India’s AI and deep‑tech ecosystem, signaling growing investor
    confidence in local generative‑AI and specialized AI startups and potentially
    accelerating product development, commercialization, and talent growth in the
    region.'

  summary: 'Researchers released Goedel‑Prover‑V2 (arXiv Aug 5, 2025), an open‑source
    family of language models that advances automated formal theorem proving. The
    paper describes scaffolded data synthesis, verifier‑guided self‑correction using
    the Lean compiler, and model averaging; the result is a 32B model that outperforms
    prior SOTA on MiniF2F and PutnamBench while a much smaller 8B variant matches
    much larger prior models. This is a notable leap for formal reasoning: higher
    proof success with smaller models makes formal verification and research‑grade
    math assistants more accessible to academia and industry, and the team has released
    code, weights and new benchmarks to accelerate follow‑up work.'

  summary: Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News (GEN) reports that Profluent published
    work (appearing in Nature) describing OpenCRISPR‑1 — an AI‑designed CRISPR‑Cas
    nuclease the company says matches (or exceeds) SpCas9’s on‑target activity while
    dramatically reducing off‑target edits and showing lower immunogenicity. The team
    trained protein language models on a massive CRISPR‑Cas atlas and released the
    sequences, models and an atlas dataset. If validated broadly, AI‑designed editors
    could speed therapeutic development and expand molecule design beyond what evolution
    has produced — but they also raise questions about safety, governance, and careful
    independent validation.

  summary: 'Thomas Dohmke, CEO of Microsoft‑owned GitHub, announced he will leave
    the company to start a new venture and will remain through the end of 2025 to
    help the transition. The move caps a tenure that included a big push into AI (GitHub’s
    Copilot products and a reported doubling of AI projects on the platform). Reports
    say Microsoft will not immediately name a replacement and that parts of GitHub’s
    leadership will report into Microsoft’s broader developer/AI organization—a shift
    that underscores tighter corporate integration and highlights intensifying competition
    in AI-powered coding tools. Industry impact: this is a notable executive change
    at one of the primary platforms for developer AI tooling, likely to accelerate
    alignment between GitHub product roadmaps and Microsoft’s CoreAI investments while
    creating an opening for rivals in the AI coding space.'

  summary: Google rolled out a new Guided Learning mode inside the Gemini app that
    acts like a step-by-step tutor (quizzes, visuals, flashcards and interactive explanations)
    to help students learn concepts rather than just get answers. The feature ties
    into Google’s broader education push (including a one-year free AI Pro plan for
    eligible students) and is designed to integrate images, videos and classroom workflows
    — a direct response to growing concerns about AI-facilitated cheating and an effort
    to position AI as a learning aid. This matters because it turns mainstream consumer
    AI into a practical study tool for classrooms and self-learners, lowering friction
    for structured learning and prompting educators to rethink how AI is used in instruction.

  summary: OpenAI published two open-weight reasoning models (gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b)
    under an Apache 2.0 license, making advanced reasoning and coding-capable models
    available for download and local use (Hugging Face and partner platforms). The
    larger model runs on a single 80GB-class GPU while the 20B variant can run on
    consumer hardware (~16GB VRAM), and OpenAI emphasizes tool use, chain-of-thought
    reasoning, and wide deployment options — aiming to democratize access for developers,
    researchers and smaller organizations. The release could accelerate hands-on experimentation,
    local development workflows, and new tools/apps that embed stronger reasoning
    capabilities without relying solely on hosted APIs, while also raising practical
    questions about safe fine-tuning and misuse. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/openai-launches-two-open-ai-reasoning-models/))

summary: >
  OpenAI’s GPT-5 launch has been bumpier than expected, with rollout glitches
  making the model fumble basic tasks and prompting the return of older
  versions while fixes roll out. Meanwhile, India’s deep-tech scene just got a
  boost with a $69M fund for AI, space, and climate startups, and researchers
  dropped Goedel-Prover-V2 — an open-source theorem-proving model that beats
  prior records with far fewer parameters. Also in AI news: Profluent claims its
  AI-designed CRISPR editor outperforms the classic Cas9, Google added a
  tutor-style “Guided Learning” mode to Gemini, and OpenAI quietly released two
  open-weight reasoning models that can run on consumer hardware.
