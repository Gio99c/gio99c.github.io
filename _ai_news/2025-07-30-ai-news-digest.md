  summary: Alibaba has open-sourced its Tongyi Wanxiang (Wan2.2) video generation
    model, capable of creating 5-second high-definition videos in a single pass. Wan2.2
    employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 27 billion parameters, reducing
    computation costs by approximately 50% while enhancing layout and detail rendering.
    This release positions Alibaba as a significant contender in the video AI-generated
    content (AIGC) sector, offering a scalable and efficient framework for high-quality
    video generation.

  summary: Runway has launched Aleph, an innovative video editing model that enables
    users to edit footage using plain language commands. Aleph supports complex tasks
    such as inserting or removing clips, changing visual styles, modifying environments,
    and even green screen keying—all through text prompts. This advancement significantly
    lowers the technical barrier for video editing, empowering a broader range of
    creators and potentially transforming content production in entertainment and
    marketing industries.

  summary: Researchers have introduced IRIS, an open-source platform designed to accelerate
    scientific discovery by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating
    novel hypotheses. IRIS incorporates features like adaptive test-time compute expansion
    via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a fine-grained feedback mechanism, and query-based
    literature synthesis. A user study across diverse disciplines validated its effectiveness
    in enhancing research ideation.

summary: "Alibaba just tossed a curveball into the video AI game with Wan2.2, a slick\
  \ open-source model making high-def video creation cheaper and more efficient. Meanwhile,\
  \ Runway's Aleph is turning heads by letting you edit videos using just plain language.\
  \ This is a big deal for anyone in content creation, making high-tech editing as\
  \ easy as typing a text. \n\nOver in the academic world, IRIS and a flood of AI\
  \ research papers are shaking things up. IRIS is helping scientists brainstorm new\
  \ ideas, while a massive drop of 117 papers on arXiv shows the AI community is laser-focused\
  \ on practical solutions. All this while EDUCAUSE is helping educators get comfy\
  \ with AI in the classroom—talk about a tech-savvy upgrade"
