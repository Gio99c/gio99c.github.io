  summary: 'NVIDIA announced general availability of Jetson AGX Thor (developer kit)
    and Jetson T5000 production modules, a Blackwell‑GPU powered robotics computer
    that delivers up to ~2,070 FP4 TFLOPS and 128 GB memory for on‑device generative
    reasoning. The launch (developer kit available now) targets humanoid and industrial
    robots by enabling multiple generative AI models and low‑latency multimodal sensor
    processing at the edge — a step toward running sophisticated vision‑language‑action
    and agentic models locally rather than in the cloud. Impact: Jetson Thor accelerates
    the ''physical AI'' market (robotics, logistics, healthcare, agriculture), lowers
    cloud dependency for robotics vendors, and tightens NVIDIA’s position as the dominant
    supplier of hardware for high‑performance on‑device AI. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Blackwell-Powered-Jetson-Thor-Now-Available-Accelerating-the-Age-of-General-Robotics/default.aspx))'

  summary: 'Perplexity announced Comet Plus — a $5/month tier for its Comet AI browser
    — and a publisher revenue‑sharing initiative that initially allocates about $42.5
    million to participating outlets. Under the plan Perplexity says ~80% of Comet
    Plus revenue (minus compute) will go to publishers based on human visits, in‑response
    citations, and agent actions. Why it matters: the move is an attempt to address
    publisher backlash and lawsuits over AI use of journalistic content by creating
    a subscription‑funded compensation model; it could pressure other AI search and
    agent companies to adopt similar publisher payment schemes and reshape the economics
    of AI‑driven search/agents. ([indianexpress.com](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/perplexity-new-comet-plus-subscription-revenue-sharing-publishers-10212605/))'

  summary: Tata Consultancy Services has appointed Amit Kapur to head a newly formed
    AI and services transformation unit, effective September — a strategic leadership
    move as the Indian IT giant scales AI offerings while recently announcing large
    job cuts. The change signals how legacy outsourcers are reorganizing around AI
    products and services to capture subdued tech spending, and could presage further
    industry restructuring and workforce reshuffles across the $283B Indian outsourcing
    sector. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-tcs-names-amit-kapur-head-newly-formed-ai-unit-company-memo-shows-2025-08-26/))

  summary: 'The Guardian reports TikTok has put several hundred UK trust-and-safety/moderation
    roles at risk as part of a global reorganisation that shifts more content-review
    work to AI systems. The move — happening amid fresh regulatory scrutiny (the Online
    Safety Act) and union pushback — underscores a broader industry trend: platforms
    are increasingly automating moderation, raising questions about safety, offshoring,
    and the future of human moderator jobs. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/25/artificial-intelligence-openai-tiktok))'

  summary: 'Google rolled out AI Mode to 180 more countries (English) and introduced
    new agentic capabilities that let the feature take multi-step actions — starting
    with restaurant reservations — plus personalized search results based on user
    preferences. The move brings more agent-like automation into Search (via Google
    Labs) and couples generative assistance with real‑world actions (booking, ticketing,
    appointments) for paid AI Ultra users. Why it matters: this makes powerful, agentic
    AI accessible to many more users and signals a shift from static answers toward
    actionable AI features embedded in everyday apps — raising competition with other
    assistant ecosystems and offering new workflows for productivity and consumer
    services.'

  summary: 'GitHub introduced an Agents panel (a popup ''mission control'') that allows
    paid Copilot subscribers to assign tasks to Copilot coding agents from any page
    on github.com, track progress, and review agent-created pull requests without
    leaving their workflow. The feature aims to make AI agents act like background
    teammates — drafting changes, running tests and preparing PRs autonomously. Why
    it matters: it simplifies using AI agents for real coding work, lowers friction
    for adopting autonomous developer tooling, and expands practical ''vibe‑coding''
    workflows for teams and individual developers while raising questions about governance,
    review practices and security in agentic development.'

summary: NVIDIA's latest move with the Jetson Thor is like handing robots a supercharged
  brain, letting them handle complex AI tasks right on the edge without always phoning
  home to the cloud. Meanwhile, Perplexity’s new subscription model is trying to make
  peace with publishers by sharing the wealth from AI-driven content, possibly nudging
  other AI players to rethink how they treat journalistic work. On a different note,
  TikTok's shift towards AI moderation is part of a wider trend, but it's stirring
  up concerns about job security and the ever-evolving balance between human oversight
  and AI efficiency.
