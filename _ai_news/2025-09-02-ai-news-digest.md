  summary: 'Eight U.S. and Indian venture and private equity firms — including Accel,
    Blume Ventures and Premji Invest — announced the India Deep Tech Investment Alliance,
    pledging more than $1 billion over the next decade to fund early-stage deep‑tech
    companies (AI, semiconductors, robotics, space, biotech, climate tech). The group
    will combine capital commitments with mentorship and policy engagement to accelerate
    India‑domiciled foundational‑tech startups and align with the government’s new
    RDI incentives. Why it matters: the pact targets a persistent funding gap for
    capital‑intensive AI and deep‑tech startups in India, could speed commercialization
    of locally incorporated models and hardware, and signals stronger U.S.–India private‑sector
    collaboration in strategic technology. Short‑term impact includes more deal flow
    and investor support for seed–Series B startups; longer‑term, it may shift where
    AI infrastructure and IP are developed and headquartered.'

  summary: 'Dolby announced Dolby Vision 2, the next generation of its HDR format
    that layers new AI‑driven ''Content Intelligence'' features — ambient‑aware tone
    mapping, Precision Black, bi‑directional tone mapping and a creative ''Authentic
    Motion'' control that applies motion smoothing on a shot‑by‑shot basis. TV makers
    including Hisense (first to ship Dolby Vision 2 on models powered by MediaTek''s
    Pentonic 800) will adopt the spec. Why it matters: Dolby Vision 2 embeds more
    automated, metadata‑driven and AI‑informed image processing into displays, shifting
    more creative control and dynamic optimization to content creators and device
    firmware. For the consumer and TV industry, it raises the bar for display IQ,
    accelerates AI integration in home entertainment hardware, and could influence
    how streaming platforms and manufacturers collaborate on metadata and playback
    intelligence.'

  summary: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told Logan Bartlett’s podcast that the company
    has reduced its customer‑support headcount from roughly 9,000 to about 5,000 after
    deploying ‘agentic’ AI (Agentforce) that now handles close to 50% of customer
    conversations. Benioff framed the move as a rebalancing that freed headcount for
    sales and said AI also helped the company follow up on a decades‑long backlog
    of leads — a concrete example of AI driving headcount shifts at a major enterprise
    vendor. The announcement is significant because it shows large enterprise software
    vendors rapidly operationalizing agentic AI in customer‑facing roles, accelerating
    cost and labor‑model changes across the industry and raising fresh questions about
    reskilling, service quality and regulatory scrutiny. ([sfchronicle.com](https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/salesforce-ai-job-cuts-benioff-21025920.php?utm_source=openai),

  summary: Krutrim — the AI division of Indian mobility group Ola — has carried out
    a third round of layoffs affecting about 50 employees in its linguistics/transcription
    teams, and the latest cuts coincide with additional leadership departures as the
    unit restructures operations. The move underscores continued consolidation and
    cost‑management at smaller AI teams inside larger consumer tech firms, and highlights
    the market pressures on language‑tech operations (localization, transcription
    and regional NLP) where margins and product‑market fit remain challenging. The
    layoffs may presage further consolidation or strategic pivots for Krutrim and
    similar in‑house AI initiatives across ride‑hailing and consumer platforms. ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/third-round-of-layoffs-more-leadership-exits-hit-krutrim/articleshow/123642927.cms?utm_source=openai))

  summary: 'Hexaware announced a strategic partnership with Replit to offer enterprise-grade,
    secure ''vibe coding'' — Replit’s natural-language AI development platform — to
    business teams. The integration adds SSO, SOC2 compliance, private deployments
    and role-based access controls so non‑engineering teams can rapidly prototype
    and build production-grade internal tools while preserving governance and security.
    Why it matters: it pushes ''vibe coding'' from individual developer productivity
    into regulated enterprise workflows, lowering barriers for product teams and business
    users to create apps while forcing IT to adopt new governance and security patterns.'

  summary: 'Elon Musk’s xAI released grok-code-fast-1, an agentic coding model designed
    to execute coding tasks quickly and economically and being offered free for a
    limited time to select partners. The model signals continued competition in turnkey
    coding assistants (alongside offerings from OpenAI, Microsoft/GitHub and others)
    and highlights a trend toward smaller, cost‑efficient models for developer tooling
    and autonomous coding agents. Why it matters: cheaper, performant coding models
    could broaden access to AI-driven development helpers and accelerate adoption
    of agentic workflows — but also raises questions about safety, code quality and
    integration with enterprise development toolchains.'

summary: India's tech scene is getting a hefty boost with a new $1B alliance between
  U.S. and Indian VCs, aimed at supporting deep-tech startups in AI and beyond. Meanwhile,
  Dolby's stepping up the HDR game with Dolby Vision 2, using AI to make your screen
  time even more stunning, while Salesforce is cutting back on support staff now that
  its AI system, Agentforce, is handling half of those customer chats. Over in the
  enterprise world, Hexaware is teaming up with Replit to spice up corporate coding
  with secure "vibe coding," making it easier for non-tech teams to build internal
  tools.
