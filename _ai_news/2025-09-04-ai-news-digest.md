  summary: DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based AI startup, is building an agentic model designed
    to carry out multi-step tasks on users’ behalf and learn from prior actions. Bloomberg
    reports the company is racing to ship an AI agent by the end of 2025 to compete
    with US players such as OpenAI. If delivered at scale, DeepSeek’s agent push could
    intensify global competition in autonomous AI assistants, accelerate China’s push
    to produce more capable multimodal/agent systems, and put pressure on incumbents
    to prioritize agent safety, integrations and cost-efficient inference.

  summary: At IFA 2025 Samsung introduced Vision AI Companion, a generative-AI powered
    experience that merges visual intelligence, conversational Bixby improvements
    and multiple AI agent features into TVs and monitors. The company says the feature
    will roll out as a software update starting late September (Korea, North America,
    select European markets) and will integrate capabilities like live translation,
    generative wallpaper, AI picture/sound optimization and partner agents (Microsoft
    Copilot, Perplexity). The launch underscores how major consumer hardware vendors
    are embedding agentic and generative AI into everyday devices — expanding where
    AI-driven assistants live and how consumers interact with them.

  summary: Mike Liberatore, xAI’s chief financial officer, has stepped down after
    a short tenure, the Wall Street Journal reported and Reuters summarized on Sept.
    3, 2025. Liberatore joined Elon Musk’s AI startup in April and reportedly left
    around late July. The departure comes as xAI pursues large capital raises and
    scales its Grok platform and data‑center plans — moves that make stable finance
    leadership critical. For the AI industry, the exit underscores ongoing executive
    churn at fast-growing AI firms and raises questions about execution risk and financial
    oversight as startups absorb massive capital and compete with entrenched players.

  summary: C3.ai reported weaker-than-expected fiscal Q1 results and on Sept. 3, 2025
    appointed Stephen Ehikian as CEO effective Sept. 1, replacing founder Thomas Siebel
    (who will remain executive chairman). The company reported revenue of about $70.3M
    for the quarter and withdrew prior full‑year guidance amid a sales reorganization.
    The leadership change — covered by CNBC and the company’s press release — is a
    major governance and strategy signal for an enterprise AI vendor facing slowing
    revenue and investor pressure. It highlights how public AI software firms are
    shifting leadership and strategy quickly in response to market expectations and
    the broader consolidation and reorientation across the AI industry.

  summary: 'Automattic demonstrated Telex at WordCamp US: an experimental, prompt-driven
    AI developer tool that can generate Gutenberg content blocks (and return them
    as installable .zip plugins) to speed up site-building without hand-coding. Telex
    is positioned as a WordPress-native ‘vibe coding’ experiment aimed at making web
    publishing more accessible, though early testers found it flaky and it remains
    labeled ‘experimental.’ This matters because WordPress powers a huge share of
    the web — a reliable AI tool for block/plugin generation could dramatically lower
    the barrier for creating custom sites and accelerate no-code/low-code workflows
    for creators and small teams. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/wordpress-shows-off-telex-its-experimental-ai-development-tool/))'

  summary: Perplexity struck a deal to give PayPal and Venmo customers a 12-month
    trial of Perplexity Pro, including access to Comet — the startup’s AI-first browser
    that embeds Perplexity’s AI search and agent features into browsing (summarizing
    pages, querying personal data like emails/calendars, scheduling, and more). The
    tie-up gives Perplexity easier onboarding via PayPal’s 430M+ user base and signals
    broader distribution of AI-native browsing tools; Perplexity is also working on
    a mobile Comet and continued feature rollouts. For developers and power users
    this highlights a new class of productivity/browser apps that blend browsing,
    agentic tasks, and paid subscriptions, and it could shift how people interact
    with the web. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/paypal-venmo-users-gain-early-access-perplexitys-comet-ai-browser-2025-09-03/))
