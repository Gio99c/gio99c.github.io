  summary: 'Reuters reports that OpenAI is projecting it will share roughly 8% of
    its revenue with commercial partners (notably Microsoft) by the end of the decade,
    down from the current ~20% — a change that could free up tens of billions of dollars
    of additional revenue for OpenAI. The article says the companies are also negotiating
    how much OpenAI will pay Microsoft to rent servers, and notes the firms signed
    a non‑binding memorandum of understanding to revise their partnership terms. Why
    it matters: this marks a major commercial re‑balancing between two of the AI industry''s
    biggest players, with implications for OpenAI’s path to raise capital or pursue
    an IPO, Microsoft’s cloud/AI business economics, and broader competition for cloud
    compute and model access.'

  summary: 'Researchers at the University of Florida published a study (reported via
    SPIE/ScienceDaily) describing a silicon photonic chip that uses etched microscopic
    Fresnel lenses and laser light to perform convolution operations — a core, energy‑hungry
    building block of many ML models. The prototype achieves near‑zero energy convolution
    with classification accuracy comparable to conventional chips (≈98% on handwritten
    digits) and can process multiple wavelengths in parallel (wavelength multiplexing).
    Why it matters: this is a concrete, experimentally demonstrated hardware advance
    toward on‑chip optical computation for ML, offering a potential pathway to drastically
    reduce the electricity footprint of training/inference pipelines and to enable
    new high‑throughput, low‑latency AI accelerators. Impact: if the approach scales
    (fabrication, integration with existing electronics, and generalization to larger,
    real‑world models), it could shift part of the hardware roadmap for AI accelerators
    and relieve growing data‑center energy pressure.'

  summary: 'The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (AI Watch) published a
    meta‑review (to be presented at AIES 2025) identifying nine major problems in
    current AI benchmarking practice — from weak construct validity and rapid obsolescence
    to commercial incentives that encourage ‘SOTA‑chasing’ and gaming. The paper recommends
    clearer task definitions, transparency, dynamic benchmarks that track model drift,
    and assessments that measure errors and harms alongside performance. Why it matters:
    as frontier models rapidly outpace static tests, regulators, researchers and purchasers
    need more robust, policy‑ready evaluation methods to accurately assess capabilities
    and risks. Impact: the taxonomy and recommendations are likely to influence how
    academic benchmarks are designed, how procurement/regulatory bodies evaluate models,
    and how conferences and workshops approach benchmark reliability and update cycles.'

  summary: Perplexity — the conversational AI search startup behind the Comet browser
    — is reported to have secured about $200 million in fresh funding that values
    the company near $20 billion. The raise (reported by multiple outlets and summarized
    here from TechCrunch's coverage) underscores continued investor appetite for AI
    search players and gives Perplexity more firepower to scale product development,
    expand its API and browser ambitions, and compete with incumbents like Google
    and OpenAI. For the industry, the round highlights how late‑stage capital is still
    flowing to AI-native consumer search and browser plays, and it may accelerate
    consolidation and further aggressive moves (partnerships, acquisitions or product
    bundling) in the AI search space.

  summary: Governments in the UK and US are set to sign a major technology agreement
    tied to AI, semiconductors and telecoms during President Trump’s state visit,
    Reuters reports. The package is expected to include multibillion‑dollar commitments
    to build AI infrastructure (including new data centres) and strategic investment
    — with reports that firms such as Nvidia and OpenAI figures will be involved and
    that investors like BlackRock may put in roughly $700 million for UK data‑centre
    capacity. The deal signals deeper transatlantic coordination on sovereign AI compute
    and supply‑chain resilience, and it could accelerate infrastructure investments
    that shape where large model training and cloud AI services are hosted — with
    implications for regulation, national security reviews and vendor partnerships.

  summary: 'At Coursera Connect (Sept 9, 2025) Coursera rolled out a set of AI-powered
    learning and authoring tools aimed at making AI and coding training faster and
    more measurable. New features include Role Play — interactive AI personas for
    practicing soft and job-specific skills — an expanded Course Builder (GenAI authoring
    tools) for education partners, AI-graded questions and peer review, and four Skill
    Tracks (GenAI, Software & Product, IT, Data) that map verified learning paths
    to employer needs. Why it matters: these product moves make it easier for organizations
    and instructors to create scalable, assessment‑backed AI/coding curricula and
    help learners gain verified, job‑aligned skills more quickly.'

  summary: 'Microsoft has started testing Windows Studio Effects on Copilot+ PCs for
    external USB and docked webcams (rolling out in preview builds), plus other Copilot
    improvements like an ''Ask Copilot'' button in File Explorer and on‑device ''fluid
    voice'' dictation. Why it matters: the updates make built‑in AI camera enhancements
    and Copilot file/query features usable in more realistic developer/remote‑work
    setups, improving productivity and accessibility for creators and developers working
    with multiple monitors and external peripherals.'

summary: 'OpenAI is shaking things up with Microsoft, cutting partner revenue shares
  down to around 8% and potentially freeing up billions in revenue. This renegotiation
  could have ripple effects on how they both approach cloud services and AI competition.
  Meanwhile, a photonic chip from the University of Florida might just revolutionize
  AI''s energy efficiency, slashing power use for convolution operations by up to
  100 times, which could be a game-changer for data centers.


  In the realm of AI search, Perplexity''s latest funding boost to a $20 billion valuation
  shows investors are still keen on backing search innovations in the AI space. And
  on the international scene, the UK and US are gearing up for a tech pact that could
  reshape AI infrastructure and investment landscapes, with heavyweights like Nvidia
  and OpenAI in the mix. Also, Coursera''s new AI-driven learning tools are making
  skill-building more accessible, while Microsoft''s Windows 11 updates are expanding
  AI features for webcams and improving user interaction through Copilot.'
