  summary: 'Anthropic has begun a controlled research preview of “Claude for Chrome,”
    a Chrome extension that embeds a Claude AI agent into the browser. The pilot is
    rolling out to 1,000 paying Max-plan users and a waitlist, letting Claude keep
    context of open tabs, read page contents, click buttons, fill forms and perform
    multi-step web tasks. Anthropic framed the release as a safety-driven experiment:
    its red-team testing found prompt-injection and other browser-specific attack
    vectors, so access is limited while the company develops mitigations. Why it matters:
    browser-embedded agents are a major step toward truly agentic consumer AI (automating
    complex web workflows), but they also expose new security and governance challenges
    that will shape enterprise adoption and regulation.'

  summary: Samsung and Microsoft have integrated Microsoft Copilot into Samsung’s
    2025 lineup of TVs and smart monitors (Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame Pro/The
    Frame and M7–M9 monitors). Copilot appears as a friendly animated on-screen assistant
    that users can summon with the remote or voice to get recommendations, spoiler-free
    episode recaps, answers, and personalized results (with sign-in). The rollout—announced
    in Samsung’s Aug. 27 press release and covered by outlets today—pushes advanced
    conversational AI onto the biggest consumer screens, signaling further platform-level
    partnerships and new use cases for living-room AI experiences.

  summary: 'TechCrunch’s Aug. 27 roundup lists 33 U.S. AI companies that have cleared
    $100 million or more in funding so far in 2025 — from healthcare and infrastructure
    plays to research labs and infrastructure providers. The piece compiles recent
    mega‑rounds (examples include EliseAI’s $250M Series E and several research‑lab
    and infra raises) and highlights sustained VC appetite for capital‑intensive AI
    startups. Why it matters: the frequency of large rounds signals robust investor
    conviction in AI commercialization, fuels hiring and product scaling, and raises
    the stakes for competition and consolidation among startups and incumbent cloud/AI
    vendors.'

  summary: 'Reuters reported on Aug. 26 that Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has created
    a dedicated AI and services transformation business and will appoint longtime
    executive Amit Kapur to head the unit starting in September. The move — the first
    among major Indian IT firms to house AI under its own business unit — comes after
    TCS announced plans earlier this year to cut 12,000 jobs. Why it matters: the
    formalization of an AI unit at a global IT leader signals a shift toward packaged
    AI offerings and commercialization of services at scale, likely accelerating client
    AI projects, reskilling/hiring priorities, and further organizational restructurings
    across the outsourcing sector.'

  summary: 'DeepLearning.AI published a new short course, Agentic Knowledge Graph
    Construction, teaching developers how to use multi-agent workflows and Google’s
    Agent Development Kit (ADK) to design and build knowledge graphs (with hands-on
    code examples and Neo4j integration). The ~3h 18m intermediate course (instructor:
    Andreas Kollegger of Neo4j) covers agentic schema extraction from structured and
    unstructured data, graph construction, and connecting graphs for improved retrieval
    systems. Why it matters: it gives practitioners a practical bridge between RAG-style
    retrieval and structured knowledge graphs — a growing pattern for making LLM outputs
    more accurate, explainable and suitable for production use — and is a timely,
    focused learning resource for engineers wanting to combine agents, RAG, and graph
    databases.'

  summary: 'Perplexity announced Comet Plus, a $5/month subscription product that
    will give participating publishers 80% of revenue tied to users’ interactions
    with their content; the company set aside a $42.5M pool to compensate early partners.
    The offering is positioned to address publisher concerns about AI summarizers
    siphoning traffic and ad revenue by creating a clearer revenue-share model tied
    to AI-driven consumption. Why it matters: Comet Plus signals one concrete business-model
    attempt to reconcile generative AI search with publisher economics — it could
    influence how AI search products surface and pay for source content, affect publisher
    negotiations, and shape user access to premium content via AI assistants.'

summary: Anthropic is testing out "Claude for Chrome," a browser extension that acts
  like your personal web assistant, but with some guardrails since it's still figuring
  out security kinks. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s Copilot is making its way to Samsung's
  2025 TVs, turning your living room into a conversational AI experience, which could
  set a new standard for how we interact with our screens. In the business world,
  TCS is betting big on AI by forming a dedicated division, while Perplexity’s Comet
  Plus is trying to find a middle ground between AI-generated content and paying publishers
  fairly—both moves showing how AI is reshaping industries from IT services to media.
