  summary: Groq, a U.S. AI‑chip startup focused on high‑speed inference hardware,
    announced a $750 million funding round that lifts its post‑money valuation to
    about $6.9 billion. The round — led by Disruptive with participation from BlackRock,
    Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Samsung, Cisco and others
    — underscores continued investor appetite for hardware that accelerates real‑time
    AI workloads. The new capital will help Groq scale production and compete in the
    fast‑moving inference market, where customers are seeking lower‑latency, cost‑efficient
    alternatives to incumbent GPU providers.

  summary: Workday signed a definitive agreement to buy Swedish AI company Sana for
    roughly $1.1 billion, bringing Sana's AI search, no‑code agents and Sana Learn
    platform into Workday’s suite. Workday says the deal will let it embed proactive,
    personalized AI agents and learning tools across its HR and finance platform—potentially
    accelerating adoption of AI‑driven productivity and upskilling for Workday’s large
    enterprise customer base. Sana will continue developing its products inside Workday,
    which plans to use its data/context to scale Sana’s capabilities to millions of
    users.

  summary: 'Researchers propose ParaThinker, a new paradigm that trains LLMs to generate
    multiple diverse reasoning trajectories in parallel and then synthesize them into
    a final answer. The approach targets the “tunnel‑vision” problem of long sequential
    chain‑of‑thought reasoning (where early mistakes lock models into bad trajectories).
    According to the paper and secondary coverage, ParaThinker yields substantial
    accuracy gains on hard math/reasoning benchmarks (reported ~12.3% for 1.5B and
    ~7.5% for 7B models with 8 parallel paths) while adding only modest latency (single‑digit
    % overhead) — enabling smaller models to match or exceed much larger sequential
    baselines. Why it matters: this reframes test‑time compute scaling from “deeper”
    chains to “wider” parallel reasoning, offering a practical path to better reasoning
    under tight latency/compute constraints and influencing how future models and
    inference systems will be designed.'

  summary: 'A team (listed on the arXiv preprint) introduces REFRAG, a decoding framework
    for retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) that compresses retrieved passages into
    chunk embeddings, selectively expands only the chunks that matter via a lightweight
    policy, and thereby dramatically reduces decoder input length and KV‑cache cost.
    Reported results show big speedups in time‑to‑first‑token (examples up to ~30×
    in the paper’s experiments) and the ability to handle much longer contexts (authors
    report up to ~16× context extension) without loss in perplexity or task accuracy.
    Why it matters: REFRAG addresses a core production bottleneck for long‑context
    RAG systems (latency and memory), making retrieval‑heavy applications — multi‑document
    QA, long‑form summarization, agent memory — far more practical at scale.'

  summary: 'Groq, an AI inference chip maker, announced a $750 million financing that
    pushes its post-money valuation to about $6.9 billion. The round—led by Disruptive
    with participation from BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Samsung, Cisco and others—boosts
    Groq’s war chest as customers and cloud providers race to diversify hardware for
    inference beyond dominant players. Why it matters: the deal underlines continued
    investor appetite for specialized AI hardware and signals more capital flowing
    into inference-focused processors, which could intensify competition with incumbents
    and influence cloud procurement and data‑center strategy.'

  summary: 'Workday signed a definitive agreement to acquire Sana—an AI company building
    enterprise knowledge search, learning and agent tools—for roughly $1.1 billion.
    Workday says integrating Sana’s search, no-code agents and personalized learning
    capabilities will let it deliver proactive, AI-driven employee experiences across
    HR and finance workflows. Why it matters: the deal is a strategic move to embed
    AI agents and knowledge tooling into core enterprise systems, accelerating the
    trend of legacy SaaS vendors snapping up AI-first startups to keep customers tied
    into integrated platforms and to compete on agent-enabled automation.'

  summary: Replit announced a $250 million funding round (valuing the company at about
    $3B) and introduced Agent 3 — an autonomous coding agent that can test and fix
    code, build custom agents and automate developer workflows. The raise (led by
    Prysm Capital with participation from Google’s AI Futures Fund and others) underlines
    investor appetite for code‑generation and ‘vibe‑coding’ platforms that let non‑engineers
    and engineers ship software faster. Agent 3 strengthens Replit’s position as a
    hands‑on coding platform (useful for learning, prototyping, and enterprise automation)
    and signals continued momentum in tools that embed AI deeply into developer workflows.

  summary: Microsoft announced new role‑based Copilot solutions for sales, service
    and finance — integrating CRM/ERP data into Microsoft 365 Copilot so teams can
    automate tasks like deal prep, CRM updates, variance analysis and report generation.
    The company is positioning these as frontline, job‑focused tools (and is adding
    management tooling for agents) to help businesses adopt AI in day‑to‑day workflows.
    For learners and builders this means more off‑the‑shelf agent templates and enterprise
    connectors to learn from or adapt; for organizations it lowers the barrier to
    deploying practical AI assistants that interact with business systems.

summary: Groq just raised a cool $750 million, pushing its valuation to $6.9 billion,
  as investors are all in on the AI inference chip game. Meanwhile, Workday is making
  moves by snapping up Swedish AI startup Sana for $1.1 billion, aiming to blend AI
  agents into their HR and finance platforms. And over at Replit, a $250 million funding
  round is helping launch Agent 3, an autonomous AI that’s set to make coding smoother
  for everyone from hobbyists to enterprise developers.
