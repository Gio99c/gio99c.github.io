  summary: Financial Times reports that Sam Altman is backing a new startup, Merge
    Labs, which aims to develop high‑bandwidth brain‑computer interfaces and compete
    with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. The company is reported to be targeting a large fundraising
    round (reports cite plans to raise roughly $250M) and lists prominent partners
    on the project. If realized, Merge Labs would raise the stakes in the BCI race
    — drawing more capital and talent into an area where deep pockets, specialized
    hardware and AI integration matter. The move highlights growing investor confidence
    in next‑generation human‑machine interfaces and intensifies direct competition
    between well‑funded private efforts in the neurotech space.

  summary: The Economic Times reports that Refold AI, a Bengaluru and San Mateo startup,
    came out of stealth on Aug. 13, 2025 with a $6.5 million seed round co‑led by
    Eniac Ventures and Tidal Ventures. Refold offers AI‑driven autonomous agents that
    learn and maintain API integrations (ERP↔CRM, finance automation, supply‑chain
    workflows), and already serves over 30 enterprise customers with ~1,500 active
    users and 30M API calls per month. The funding will expand engineering and integration
    capabilities. The story underscores continued investor appetite for vertical AI
    infrastructure that reduces costly manual integration work across large enterprises.

  summary: 'New research from the UK’s AI Security Institute together with EleutherAI
    shows that selectively removing hazardous domain content from training corpora
    — a technique the authors call “deep ignorance” — can substantially weaken an
    open-source model’s ability to generate or help design biological hazards while
    leaving general capabilities nearly intact. The team trained variants of Pythia‑6.9B
    on filtered vs. unfiltered datasets and report improved safety on biorisk benchmarks
    with only minor drops on broader biology tests and negligible compute overhead
    (~<1% extra). Why it matters: this challenges the widely repeated claim that only
    ever-larger, unfiltered datasets can produce useful models and suggests an actionable,
    auditable data‑level safety lever that regulators and researchers could adopt
    to reduce specific misuse risks without forfeiting model utility.'

  summary: 'An arXiv preprint (submitted Aug 6, revised Aug 12, 2025) presents a data‑driven
    critique of the current centralized AI conference ecosystem, documenting scientific,
    environmental, mental‑health and logistical stresses (e.g., rising per‑author
    publication rates, high carbon footprints, negative online sentiment and venue
    capacity limits). The authors propose a Community‑Federated Conference (CFC) model
    that decouples peer review, presentation, and networking into locally organized
    but globally coordinated components to improve inclusivity, reduce emissions,
    and relieve pressure on reviewers and venues. Why it matters: the proposal targets
    systemic, disciplinary‑level change in how AI research is evaluated and disseminated
    — a shift that could reshape peer review, conference carbon footprints, and community
    norms if adopted or piloted by major venues (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/IJCAI/etc.).'

  summary: AI search startup Perplexity submitted an unsolicited all-cash offer of
    roughly $34.5 billion to buy Google’s Chrome browser (reporting Aug 12, 2025).
    The move — far larger than Perplexity’s own reported valuation — appears aimed
    at securing Chrome’s massive user base to accelerate Perplexity’s browser and
    search ambitions and to capitalize on regulatory pressure that has put Google’s
    dominance under scrutiny. Even if unlikely to succeed, the bid signals aggressive,
    headline-grabbing tactics by well‑funded AI rivals and further escalates competitive
    and antitrust narratives around control of key consumer-facing distribution channels
    for AI services.

  summary: 'CoreWeave reported Q2 results (Aug 12, 2025) showing revenue of about
    $1.21 billion — well above estimates — driven by strong AI compute demand, but
    a much larger-than-expected net loss (roughly $290.5M) sent shares lower in after-hours
    trading. Management raised full‑year revenue guidance even as operating expenses
    and stock‑based comp ballooned. The report highlights the tension in AI infrastructure
    names: explosive top-line demand for GPU capacity but heavy capital intensity,
    customer concentration and margin pressure, raising questions about how quickly
    such providers can translate growth into sustainable profits.'

  summary: 'Microsoft has integrated OpenAI’s newly released GPT‑5 across its Copilot
    ecosystem (Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Azure AI Foundry and Copilot
    Studio), and introduced a “smart mode” that routes tasks to the best model automatically.
    The change brings GPT‑5’s longer context, stronger reasoning and improved code
    generation into everyday productivity and developer tools — meaning faster, more
    capable code completion, enhanced meeting/notes workflows, and easier agent-building
    for enterprises. For developers and teams this reduces friction when using multiple
    models, and for learners it makes Copilot a more powerful hands‑on coding tutor.
    The rollout began in early August and many features (Copilot Pages, mobile voice
    interactions, expanded grounding on Loop/Teams) are arriving throughout August.

  summary: 'Replit’s CEO says AI‑driven ‘vibe coding’ — using natural‑language prompts
    + Replit Agent to generate multi‑file apps and live previews — has lowered the
    barrier to building software, enabling non‑technical creators to ship prototypes
    and small businesses to launch products quickly. The trend is powering a surge
    in one‑person startups and offers a practical learning pathway for people who
    want to learn coding by doing: spawn an app, inspect/edit the generated code,
    iterate and deploy. Replit’s Agent (including Agent v2 improvements) and growing
    ecosystem are positioned as both productivity tools and informal, hands‑on learning
    environments for new coders. URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/replit-ceo-vibe-coding-solo-startups-2025-8'

summary: Sam Altman is throwing his weight behind Merge Labs, a new player in the
  brain-computer interface game, hoping to outsmart Neuralink with a hefty $250M fundraising
  goal. This move amps up the competition in the neurotech space, where deep pockets
  and AI prowess are setting the stage for next-gen human-machine hookups. Meanwhile,
  Microsoft is rolling out GPT-5 across its Copilot tools, making it easier for developers
  to harness AI’s power, just as Replit’s ‘vibe coding’ is letting solo creators whip
  up apps in no time, fueling a wave of one-person startups.
