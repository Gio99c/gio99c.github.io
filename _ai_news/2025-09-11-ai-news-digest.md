  summary: Oracle disclosed four multi‑billion‑dollar cloud contracts tied to AI infrastructure,
    sending its shares up roughly 40% — the biggest one‑day gain since 1992 — and
    pushing the company toward a trillion‑dollar valuation. The deals highlight surging
    demand for AI compute and position Oracle as a major backer of large‑scale model
    training and inference, with knock‑on effects for cloud competition, data‑center
    buildout plans, and enterprises betting on AI. Market reaction underscores how
    commercial AI contracts are reshaping valuations and vendor‑partner dynamics across
    the industry.

  summary: Microsoft announced that, starting in October, its Copilot for Sales, Service
    and Finance capabilities will be included at no extra cost for Microsoft 365 Copilot
    customers, effectively simplifying pricing and widening access to business‑focused
    AI agents. The move signals Microsoft’s push to make role‑based AI agents mainstream
    inside productivity suites, and previews broader agent management tooling (Agent
    365) to be highlighted at Ignite — a strategic step to drive enterprise adoption
    and compete on integrated AI experiences.

  summary: 'Nebius Group said it will raise $3 billion — a $2 billion private offering
    of convertible senior notes plus a $1 billion underwritten public offering of
    class A shares — after striking a multi‑year GPU infrastructure deal with Microsoft.
    The Microsoft contract, initially valued at $17.4 billion and potentially rising
    to about $19.4 billion if Microsoft buys more capacity, sent Nebius shares sharply
    higher and underscores surging demand for dedicated AI compute. Why it matters:
    the fundraising will bankroll rapid expansion of data‑center and GPU capacity
    at a moment hyperscalers and AI labs are racing to secure specialized infrastructure;
    it highlights how smaller, GPU‑focused cloud providers can capture outsized market
    value by locking in long‑term contracts with Big Tech, and signals continued heavy
    corporate spending on AI compute that will ripple across chip suppliers, data‑center
    developers and financing markets.'

  summary: 'Microsoft’s September 2025 cumulative update for Windows 11 (version 24H2)
    began rolling out with several user-facing improvements — notably a redesigned
    Recall homepage, a new interactive tutorial for the Copilot-driven ''Click to
    Do'' feature on Copilot+ PCs, expanded Settings AI agent coverage (now supporting
    AMD and Intel NPUs), and privacy controls that log recent third‑party AI activity.
    Why it matters: these updates push more everyday AI tooling into the OS (and make
    them easier to adopt), while adding visibility and controls that matter for user
    trust and enterprise rollout. Impact: Windows users with Copilot+ hardware will
    get smoother onboarding and broader access to local AI helpers; IT teams should
    note new privacy/activity logs and hardware prerequisites (40+ TOPS NPU + BitLocker/device-encryption
    + Windows Hello).'

  summary: 'Boot.dev’s September update introduces ''Training Grounds'' — a personalized
    practice-challenge generator that creates coding and interview-style exercises
    tailored to learners’ progress — plus new ''Boots'' interview-style lessons and
    a published walkthrough of its AI Agent course (Python) on FreeCodeCamp’s YouTube
    channel. Why it matters: these are practical, learner-focused features that help
    people turning theoretical AI/coding knowledge into repeatable, hands-on skills
    (practice generation, interactive interview simulation, and refreshed web-scraping
    courses). Impact: developers and students looking to level up in AI agents, RAG,
    and scraping workflows get more targeted practice and guided walkthroughs — useful
    for job prep and real projects.'
