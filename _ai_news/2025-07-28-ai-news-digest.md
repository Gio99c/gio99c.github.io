  summary: In response to escalating U.S. export restrictions, Chinese AI companies
    have established two new industry alliances to foster a self-reliant domestic
    AI ecosystem. The 'Model-Chip Ecosystem Innovation Alliance' unites AI chip producers
    like Huawei and Biren with large language model developers such as StepFun, aiming
    to synergize technologies across chips, models, and infrastructure. A second alliance,
    formed under the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce AI Committee, seeks to integrate
    AI into industrial transformation, including firms like SenseTime and MiniMax.
    These initiatives were announced during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference
    in Shanghai, where Huawei also introduced its CloudMatrix 384 system, reportedly
    rivaling Nvidia's top models.
