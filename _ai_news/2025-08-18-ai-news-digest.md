  summary: Tredence launched Milky Way, a multi‑agent, multi‑turn AI platform that
    ships with 15+ prebuilt business agents and 50+ specialised agents (marketing,
    supply‑chain, text‑to‑SQL, anomaly detection, etc.) designed to act like autonomous
    digital co‑workers for enterprises. The company positions Milky Way as a way to
    speed time‑to‑insight, lower analytics costs and move organizations from experiments
    to production by integrating agents with existing data stacks, audit trails and
    role‑based controls — a sign of growing vendor focus on ‘agentic’ AI for real
    business outcomes. ([techcircle.in](https://www.techcircle.in/2025/08/18/tredence-launches-new-agentic-ai-platform))

  summary: Parag Agrawal unveiled Parallel Web Systems and its Deep Research API,
    a cloud platform that lets AI agents perform long‑form, web‑scale research (the
    company says its Ultra8x engine outperformed GPT‑5 and humans on BrowseComp and
    DeepResearch Bench). Parallel — backed by prominent VCs and claiming millions
    of daily research tasks from early adopters — aims to be infrastructure for AI
    agents to fetch, verify and cite live web information, a capability that could
    shift how AI products access up‑to‑date data and reduce hallucinations in agent
    workflows. ([indianexpress.com](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/parag-agrawal-ex-twitter-ceo-launches-ai-startup-parallel-10196413/))

  summary: The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NVIDIA announced a joint
    investment to fund the Open Multimodal AI Infrastructure to Accelerate Science
    (OMAI), led by the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2). With $75M from NSF and $77M from
    NVIDIA, the project will develop fully open multimodal large models trained on
    scientific literature and domain data, release weights/code/data, and provide
    infrastructure and workforce programs so academic researchers can run and build
    on state-of-the-art scientific models. This is a major public‑private push to
    make high‑quality scientific foundation models broadly accessible, lowering cost
    barriers for university labs and accelerating research in materials, protein science,
    and other fields while advancing reproducibility and openness in AI-for-science.

  summary: A team at MIT published results showing generative AI pipelines that produced
    millions of candidate molecules and yielded entirely novel antibiotic candidates
    — including compounds effective against drug‑resistant gonorrhea and MRSA in lab
    and mouse models. The study (published in Cell and summarized by MIT News) combines
    fragment‑based and unconstrained generative approaches plus computational filtering
    and synthesis to find molecules with new mechanisms of action. The work demonstrates
    how modern generative models can expand chemical search spaces, accelerating early‑stage
    drug discovery and potentially opening new avenues for tackling antimicrobial
    resistance — though candidates still require extensive medicinal chemistry and
    clinical testing.

  summary: 'On Aug. 18, 2025 Yext CEO Michael Walrath proposed a $1.1 billion take‑private
    transaction, offering $9.00 per share in cash and prompting the company to withdraw
    its fiscal‑2026 guidance while a special committee evaluates the bid. Yext provides
    software that helps companies manage their visibility across AI platforms, search
    engines and digital channels. Why it matters: the move highlights strategic consolidation
    and private‑equity style deals in companies positioned around AI search and distributed
    discovery — a sign that management and insiders may prefer private ownership to
    pursue longer‑term AI product investments without public‑market pressure. Industry
    impact: if completed, the deal could encourage similar privatization plays among
    niche AI infrastructure or search‑adjacent vendors seeking flexibility to invest
    heavily in AI R&D and go‑to‑market shifts away from quarterly earnings scrutiny.'

  summary: 'Business Insider reports (Aug. 18, 2025) that Anthropic is raising about
    $5 billion at an estimated $170 billion valuation and is telling investors it
    will be selective about investment vehicles — rejecting special purpose vehicles
    (SPVs) from some backers. Why it matters: the restriction signals outsized demand
    for private allocations in top AI labs and gives Anthropic leverage to push for
    direct, long‑term institutional investors rather than layered SPV arrangements.
    Industry impact: the dynamics underline intense competition among large investors
    for access to premier AI firms, and reflect maturation of fundraising practices
    as AI startups seek strategic, stable backers while managing governance and investor
    relations ahead of potential future liquidity events.'

  summary: 'Vibecode, a new startup offering an iOS app that turns plain-English prompts
    into working apps, raised a $9.4 million seed round led by Alexis Ohanian’s Seven
    Seven Six. Launched earlier in 2025, the app lets non‑developers describe an app
    idea and iteratively refine generated code; the company now supports multiple
    large models (including GPT‑5 and Anthropic’s Claude) and offers subscription
    tiers for heavier usage. Why it matters: Vibecode is part of the growing ‘vibe
    coding’ wave that lowers the barrier to software creation — useful for hobbyists,
    entrepreneurs, and learners who want rapid prototyping without deep coding experience
    — and signals continued investor interest in AI tools that democratize app-building.'

  summary: 'Google announced a three‑year, $1 billion commitment to expand AI education,
    training and tools for U.S. colleges and nonprofits, and is offering eligible
    college students a free 12‑month subscription to its AI Pro/Gemini Advanced plan.
    The student offer includes access to Gemini 2.5 Pro (for reasoning and homework
    help), NotebookLM for organizing research, Deep Research/related study tools,
    Veo 3 for short video generation, and expanded access to Jules — an AI coding
    assistant. Why it matters: the initiative packages powerful AI tools with curriculum
    and grants to rapidly upskill students and educators, shaping how a new generation
    learns to use AI for research, coding and creative projects while increasing institutional
    adoption of vendor AI ecosystems.'

summary: Tredence's Milky Way could be a game-changer for businesses looking to integrate
  AI into their operations, offering a suite of prebuilt agents designed to act like
  digital coworkers. Meanwhile, Parag Agrawal's Parallel aims to redefine how AI pulls
  information from the web, which might just help AI systems stop hallucinating data.
  On another note, MIT's use of generative AI to craft new antibiotics offers a glimpse
  into the future of drug discovery, potentially tackling the stubborn issue of drug-resistant
  bacteria.
