  summary: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has postponed the rollout of its next model
    after failing to train it successfully on Huawei’s domestically made chips, underscoring
    limits in China’s effort to replace U.S. AI hardware and potentially slowing the
    company’s product roadmap and competitive positioning. The delay spotlights broader
    supply-chain and performance challenges for Chinese AI firms that are trying to
    move away from Western processors, and could affect timelines for other locally
    developed models that depend on domestic silicon. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/deepseeks-launch-new-ai-model-delayed-by-huawei-chip-issues-ft-reports-2025-08-14/))

  summary: Arintra, a Texas-based startup building a GenAI-native autonomous medical
    coding platform, raised $21 million in a Series A led by Peak XV Partners to accelerate
    product development, hire, and open a Bay Area HQ. The platform automates coding
    inside EHRs (integrating with systems such as Epic and Athena), promising to reduce
    claim denials and coding costs for health systems — a notable step in commercialization
    of revenue-cycle AI tools in healthcare. ([economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/healthcare-focused-startup-arintra-raises-21-million-in-funding-round-led-by-peak-xv-partners/articleshow/123297667.cms))

  summary: 'What happened: A fresh arXiv preprint (Aug 5, 2025) from researchers including
    Zeju Li proposes “step entropy,” a metric that measures the informational contribution
    of each intermediate Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) step and uses it to prune low‑value
    steps. The paper reports that up to ~80% of low‑entropy steps can be removed with
    only minor accuracy loss on several math reasoning benchmarks, and introduces
    a two‑stage SFT + Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training recipe so
    models can learn to emit [SKIP] tokens and produce compressed CoTs at inference
    time. Why it matters: CoT prompting gives big reasoning gains but is expensive
    at inference; principled compression could dramatically cut token usage, latency
    and cost for reasoning models while preserving interpretability. Impact: If validated
    broadly, the method could make high‑quality reasoning with LLMs far cheaper to
    deploy (important for on‑device and cost‑sensitive services), and opens new lines
    of research on which internal reasoning steps are actually necessary versus redundant.'

  summary: 'What happened: An arXiv preprint (Aug 3, 2025) summarized in the weekly
    arXiv roundup by AskAiBrain presents Refine‑n‑Judge, an automated pipeline that
    uses a single LLM both to refine candidate outputs and to judge whether refinements
    are improvements — looping until no further improvement is found. Why it matters:
    Preference‑based fine‑tuning (SFT+DPO/RL) depends heavily on high‑quality preference
    chains, and human labeling is expensive. Refine‑n‑Judge promises to produce scalable,
    higher‑quality preference sequences without a separate reward/judge model or massive
    human labeling. Impact: The authors report measurable gains (e.g., +5% on AlpacaEval
    variants, +19% on MT‑Bench in their experiments) and show models fine‑tuned on
    these auto‑curated chains are preferred by judge models; if results hold across
    domains, this could reduce the human cost of alignment and speed practical deployments
    of better-aligned open models.'

  summary: 'Abridge — the San Francisco startup that builds AI tools to transcribe
    and summarize patient‑doctor conversations — told Business Insider it has raised
    roughly $700 million over the last 18 months, hit a $5.3 billion valuation, and
    is now reserving about 20% of its capital for acquisitions to buy talent, data
    and adjacent tech (while keeping 80% for product development). This signals consolidation
    pressure in healthcare AI (where incumbents and deep‑pocketed PE firms are active)
    and shows startups are using mega‑rounds to both scale products and pursue inorganic
    growth. Impact: more consolidation in AI clinical‑workflow tooling, faster product
    roadmaps for buyers, and heightened competition for domain data and talent. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/abridge-wants-to-buy-healthcare-ai-startups-2025-8))'

  summary: 'CoreWeave reported Q2 revenue that beat estimates ($1.21B) and raised
    its 2025 revenue outlook, but a larger‑than‑expected net loss sent shares lower;
    the company reiterated its planned $9 billion all‑stock acquisition of data‑center
    operator Core Scientific — a deal intended to secure 1.3GW of power capacity —
    even as Core Scientific’s biggest shareholder said it would vote against the sale.
    Why it matters: the report highlights how AI hyperscalers are aggressively pursuing
    upstream infrastructure (power and data‑center ownership) to lock supply, while
    deal dynamics (stock volatility and shareholder opposition) can materially reshape
    M&A outcomes and financing risk for AI infrastructure plays. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/coreweave-revenue-beats-estimates-ai-boom-shares-fall-bigger-loss-2025-08-12/))'
