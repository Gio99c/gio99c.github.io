  summary: Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaGenome, a deep learning model capable
    of predicting thousands of functional genomic tracks directly from DNA sequences
    at single base-pair resolution. By unifying multimodal prediction, long-range
    sequence context, and high resolution in a single framework, AlphaGenome matches
    or exceeds the performance of specialized models across various genomic tasks.
    This breakthrough enhances the interpretation of non-coding variants in disease
    and supports large-scale genome analysis, marking a significant step forward in
    genomic research.

  summary: AI startup Anthropic is in early discussions to raise a new funding round
    that could more than double its valuation to over $150 billion, up from its current
    $61.5 billion. The company, which competes with OpenAI in developing advanced
    AI models, is expected to raise at least $3 billion, potentially up to $5 billion.
    Interest has emerged from several large Middle Eastern investors, including Abu
    Dhabi-based AI fund MGX. Although Anthropic has been cautious about accepting
    funding from the region due to ethical concerns, prior secondary share purchases
    linked to MGX have occurred. Backed by Google and Amazon — the latter with a current
    $8 billion commitment and potential for further investment — Anthropic is ramping
    up its business-focused subscription revenue, now exceeding $4 billion annually.
    However, the company, like its rivals OpenAI and xAI, remains unprofitable due
    to high computing costs and fierce competition for AI talent. This funding round
    positions Anthropic as a major contender in the AI space, where OpenAI continues
    to lead, with ChatGPT surpassing 500 million weekly users and a $300 billion valuation.

  summary: Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is reportedly seeking to raise up to $12 billion
    in debt financing to support its expansion, according to the Wall Street Journal.
    Valor Equity Partners, closely tied to Musk through its founder Antonio Gracias,
    is in discussions with lenders to secure the funding. The capital will be used
    to acquire a large number of advanced Nvidia chips that will be leased to xAI
    for powering and training its AI chatbot, Grok, in a massive data center. Some
    lenders are proposing a three-year loan term with borrowing caps to mitigate risk.
    xAI is currently training Grok using a supercluster of 230,000 GPUs, including
    Nvidia GB200 chips, with plans to add another supercluster using 550,000 GB200
    and GB300 chips. Despite reports that xAI may spend around $13 billion in 2025
    and could be valued between $170 billion and $200 billion, Musk has publicly claimed
    that the company is not actively seeking funding and has adequate capital.
