  summary: Microsoft Research published a new training framework, rStar2‑Agent, that
    uses agentic reinforcement learning and infrastructure optimizations to enable
    a 14B model to reach near‑state‑of‑the‑art reasoning performance with far less
    compute than much larger models. The technique (including GRPO‑RoC and an efficient
    tool‑using training recipe) lets smaller models use tool calls (Python interpreter)
    and resample high‑quality reasoning trajectories to learn more reliable, concise
    answers — a promising path for enterprises to build cheaper, more reliable AI
    agents without massive GPU budgets. This could shift how companies approach agentic
    AI (favoring smarter training recipes and tool‑use over sheer scale) and lower
    the barrier for organizations to deploy capable reasoning assistants in production.

  summary: Bloomberg reports that Naveen Rao, Databricks’ head of AI, is exiting to
    launch a new venture focused on building a novel type of computer. Databricks
    will transition Rao to an advisory role and is planning to invest in his new startup.
    The move signals talent and capital flows from large AI/cloud companies into hardware
    and systems startups—an area investors and incumbents see as strategically important
    as compute demands rise for next‑generation models. If the new company succeeds,
    it could accelerate specialized compute innovation and deepen partnerships between
    infrastructure and AI software players. ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-12/databricks-ai-chief-to-exit-launch-a-new-computer-startup))

  summary: Perplexity AI has reportedly raised about $200 million in new funding,
    pushing its valuation to roughly $20 billion as the conversational search startup
    expands product and infrastructure spending — a fresh sign investors continue
    to back late‑stage AI search challengers amid heavy competition with Google and
    ChatGPT‑powered services. The influx helps Perplexity scale compute and product
    efforts while intensifying consolidation pressure in the AI search/assistant market.

  summary: Microsoft and OpenAI have signed a non‑binding memorandum of understanding
    that paves the way for OpenAI to restructure into a more conventional for‑profit
    entity — a move aimed at unlocking large private capital and potential public-market
    options while preserving continued commercial ties with Microsoft. The arrangement
    signals a major re‑engineering of governance and cloud partnerships for one of
    the industry’s most consequential AI players, but it still faces regulatory sign‑offs
    in states including California and Delaware and could reshape cloud competition
    and funding dynamics across the AI sector. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-non-binding-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-09-11/))

  summary: 'TechTarget published a hands‑on tutorial showing how to install LangChain,
    connect it to an LLM (example uses Google Gemini), add the File System tool and
    create a simple agent that can read, write and list local files. Why it matters:
    LangChain remains the go‑to framework for developer‑focused agent and tool integrations
    — this beginner guide lowers the bar for engineers who want to move from prompts
    to practical, tool‑enabled agents and learn the exact commands and code patterns
    used in production workflows. Impact: useful for engineers and learners building
    agentic AI, prototyping tool‑enabled assistants, and for educators creating practical
    coding labs. ([techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tutorial/Build-an-AI-agent-with-LangChain-in-this-beginner-tutorial))'

  summary: 'The Times of India reports that IIT Madras (via the Pravartak Technologies
    Foundation) launched six free online AI courses for school teachers — including
    a general ''AI for Educators'' plus AI in Physics, Chemistry, Accounting, Cricket
    Analytics and AI/ML with Python. No prior coding experience required; courses
    run 25–45 hours with optional paid certification. Why it matters: expands practical,
    hands‑on AI literacy for K‑12 teachers and offers accessible entry points to coding
    and AI pedagogy — a useful resource for educators and anyone building classroom
    AI curricula. ([timesofindia.indiatimes.com](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/iit-m-launches-free-ai-course-for-school-teachers/articleshow/123793634.cms))'

summary: 'Microsoft''s new rStar2-Agent is shaking things up by letting smaller AI
  models get real smart without needing a ton of computing power. This could make
  it easier for companies to deploy capable AI without breaking the bank, signaling
  a shift in how AI is trained and applied. Meanwhile, Databricks’ AI head is branching
  out to start a computer company, with Databricks backing him, highlighting the ongoing
  blend of AI talent and hardware innovation.


  In the world of AI search, Perplexity AI just snagged a $200 million funding boost,
  bringing its valuation to a staggering $20 billion. This shows that investors are
  still betting big on AI search technologies, potentially heating up competition
  with giants like Google. On the educational front, IIT Madras is offering free AI
  courses for teachers, making AI skills more accessible to educators and helping
  them bring AI concepts into classrooms without pre-existing coding expertise.'
