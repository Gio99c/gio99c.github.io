  summary: Generative AI startup ProRata.ai announced a $40 million Series B and the
    launch of Gist Answers, an embeddable AI search tool that lets publishers provide
    AI-generated summaries and recommendations based on their own content (or content
    from ProRata’s 750-publisher network). The product pairs a 50/50 revenue‑share
    licensing model with publisher attribution, positioning the company as an infrastructure
    play to help publishers get paid and regain control over how their content is
    used by AI systems. The funding will be used to expand the team and accelerate
    distribution — a timely offering as publishers push back on scraping and seek
    new monetization paths in the generative‑AI era.

  summary: Reuters reports—citing the Financial Times—that OpenAI is planning to produce
    its first custom AI chip in 2026 in partnership with Broadcom (with fabrication
    reportedly at TSMC). The chip is said to be for OpenAI’s internal use to reduce
    reliance on third‑party suppliers like Nvidia and to control costs and capacity
    for large model training and inference. If confirmed, this follows a broader industry
    trend of big AI players developing bespoke silicon and could materially change
    infrastructure dynamics and vendor negotiations across the AI compute market.

  summary: 'Generative-AI startup ProRata.ai announced a $40 million Series B (reported
    Sept. 5, 2025) to fund a new product, Gist Answers — an embeddable AI search/summarization
    tool that lets publishers serve AI-generated answers from their own paywalled
    content (and a network of ~750 publishers). The raise (led by Touring Capital,
    per reporting) and product push aim to create a monetization alternative to large-model
    content scraping by routing user queries and payments through publishers’ properties.
    Industry impact: the deal highlights a growing trend of startups building publisher-aligned
    AI infrastructure and commercial models that try to redirect AI value back to
    content owners; it could accelerate publisher adoption of first-party AI search
    and set a template for revenue-sharing with LLMs.'

  summary: 'Enterprise-AI vendor C3.ai announced a leadership change (effective Sept.
    1, 2025) appointing Stephen Ehikian as CEO while founder Thomas Siebel moves to
    executive chairman; the move accompanied fiscal Q1 results showing revenue down
    year‑over‑year ($70.3M) and the company withdrawing prior guidance. The leadership
    swap and weak results triggered stock declines and signal a critical inflection
    for a well-known enterprise-AI player: new leadership with federal procurement
    experience could refocus product and sales strategy, but investors and customers
    will watch closely for signs C3 can regain growth amid tougher enterprise buying
    and competition in AI tooling.'

  summary: Generative-AI startup ProRata.ai announced a $40M Series B and the launch
    of Gist Answers, a plug-in AI search/summary widget publishers can embed on their
    sites. The product generates AI summaries and recommendations based on a publisher’s
    own content (or content from ProRata’s 750‑publisher network) and shares revenue
    with participating publishers under a 50/50 model. The move targets the ongoing
    dispute over AI models scraping journalism and aims to give publishers a way to
    monetize and control AI-driven discovery of their work — a practical tool for
    publishers and newsrooms to both surface content and capture value from AI usage.

  summary: At a White House event launching the 'Presidential AI Challenge', tech
    firms and education groups pledged major training and tool commitments to bring
    AI into K–12 classrooms. Companies including Google, IBM and Microsoft pledged
    expanded access to tools and free AI trainings; Code.org said it would engage
    25 million learners, and IBM pledged training for 2 million workers. The initiative
    signals large-scale distribution of AI learning resources and classroom tooling,
    while prompting debate about student safety, oversight and the role of big tech
    in education policy. For educators and learners, this could mean increased access
    to AI curricula, platforms and trainings — but also renewed scrutiny over implementation,
    safety and accountability.

summary: ProRata.ai just snagged $40 million to roll out Gist Answers, an AI search
  tool that lets publishers control and monetize their content, standing out as a
  nifty solution for the AI scraping dilemma. Meanwhile, OpenAI might be getting its
  hands dirty with its own AI chip production by 2026 alongside Broadcom, a move that
  could shake up the current reliance on big names like Nvidia. Over in the education
  world, the White House's 'Presidential AI Challenge' is pushing AI into classrooms,
  with tech giants like Google and IBM pledging to train millions, sparking both excitement
  and concerns over tech's growing influence in education.
