  summary: Researchers have introduced SENSEI, a framework that integrates Vision
    Language Models (VLMs) into reinforcement learning to guide agents toward semantically
    meaningful behaviors. This approach enables agents to predict rewards through
    a world model, facilitating the discovery of diverse behaviors in both robotic
    and video game simulations. The study highlights the potential of leveraging foundation
    models to enhance exploration strategies in AI systems.

  summary: A new knowledge-driven multimodal agent, COSINT-Agent, has been developed
    to address challenges in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) within the Chinese domain.
    By combining fine-tuned multimodal large language models with structured reasoning
    through an Entity-Event-Scene Knowledge Graph, COSINT-Agent effectively extracts
    and contextualizes insights from diverse data sources. This innovation demonstrates
    significant improvements in tasks such as entity recognition and event interpretation,
    marking a step forward in automated multimodal reasoning for intelligence gathering.
