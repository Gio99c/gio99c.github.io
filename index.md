# Hi, I'm Giuseppe Concialdi

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Large Language Models and Generative AI. I build systems that understand and generate natural language at scale. 

Currently, I focus on:
* **LLM Architecture & Training** - Designing and optimizing transformer-based models
* **Generative AI Applications** - Building practical AI systems for real-world problems  
* **MLOps & Infrastructure** - Scaling ML systems for production environments

Outside of work, I write about cutting-edge developments in AI, share insights from building with LLMs, and explore the latest research in generative models.
