## Background

My journey in machine learning began with a fascination for how computers could understand and generate human language. Over the years, I've specialized in building and deploying large-scale AI systems, with particular expertise in:

**Large Language Models**
* Model architecture design and optimization
* Fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific applications
* Efficient training techniques and distributed computing

**Generative AI**
* Text generation and creative AI applications
* Multimodal model development
* Prompt engineering and AI-human interaction design

**MLOps & Infrastructure**
* Production ML system design
* Model deployment and monitoring
* Scalable training infrastructure

## Technical Focus

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of research and practical applications. My work often involves:

* **Transformer Architectures** - Exploring attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and architectural innovations
* **Training Efficiency** - Developing methods to train large models more efficiently
* **AI Safety & Alignment** - Ensuring AI systems behave predictably and beneficially
* **Applied Research** - Bridging the gap between academic research and industry applications

## Writing & Sharing

Through this blog, I aim to share insights from both the research frontier and the trenches of building production AI systems. I write about:

* Deep dives into model architectures and training techniques
* Practical lessons from deploying LLMs in production
* Analysis of the latest research papers and their implications
* Tools and methodologies for ML engineers
